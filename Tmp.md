I consider myself on the borderline between knowledgeable and expert. 
However, I rated myself as knowledgeable because I do not feel I am an expert in flow-sensitivity. 
For example, my uncertainty about the design quality of the proposed flow-sensitivity technique (e.g., whether the design is an innovative design or not). 
I assessed it based on the experimental results.
