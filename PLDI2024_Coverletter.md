# Cover Letter

Below lists the required revision in the meta-review, and how we addressed the comments in the revised paper.


# Mandatory Revisions
## 1. Incorporate rebuttal content into the paper.

## 1.1 limitation & future work section (expressiveness, scalability, classification only)

- We revised Section 7 (Limitation and Future Work) to discuss the limitations of our approach on expressiveness, scalability, classification only (see lines 1002 - 1038 in diff.pdf).

## 1.2 Experiment section: revise figure 9 for better cost presentation; explain fidelity better; add qualitative analysis

- We replaced the figure with Table 2 for separately show the three costs (see lines 687-716 in diff.pdf).

- We included an intuitive explanation about the metric fidelity (see lines 773 - 775 in diff.pdf).

- We included a qualitative analysis (see lines 966 - 989 in diff.pdf).

## 1.3 Elaborate search depth in the technical section

- We elaborated it in Section 5.2 (see lines 497 - 509 in diff.pdf).

## 1.4 compare with subgraph based approach (in related work)

- We included the comparison in related work (see lines 1081 - 10943 in diff.pdf).

## 2. Revise intro/overview for better framing:

## 2.1 better define scope and expressiveness, 

- We clarified the scope of our paper in Section 1 (Introduction) (see lines 132-135 in diff.pdf).
- The expressiveness is clarified in Section 2 (Overview) (see lines 191 - 222 in diff.pdf).

## 2.2 clarify "correctness of explanations"


- We included illustrations for clarifying "correctness of explanations" in Section 2 (Overview) (see lines 185 - 189 in diff.pdf), and we clarify that the metric fidelity is a proxy metric for measuring the correctness of explanations in Section 1 (Introduction) (see lines 111 - 114 in diff.pdf).

## Optional Revisions

## 3. Evaluate on large dataset from SubgraphX

- We included a large dataset HIV to show the training cost limitation of PL4XGL (see lines 589-596 and lines 706-709 in diff.pdf).

## 4. Evaluate with different search depth to show tradeoff between performance and time

- We included the experiment in the revised paper (see lines 981 - 1000 in diff.pdf).

## 5. Incorporate the example in rebuttal comparing GDL and subgraphs in the paper, this example will also help general audience to understand the difference better

- We include the example in Section 8 of our revised paper (see lines 1040 - 1061 in diff.pdf).
