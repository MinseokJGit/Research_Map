Dear Maria Galkina,

I think you are asking why your submitted codes for problem 2 in weeks 4 and 5 are incorrect.

I attached the two codes (Week4_problem2.c and Week5_problem2.c) I scored with. Please check the below.

[1] (Week4_problem2.c). 

Please check the output when 555 and 345 are given as  inputs. The program needs to print 2 because carry operation occurs twice, but your program prints 1. 

[2] (Week5_problem2.c). 

Please check the output when the input is 25. The program needs to print 1 5 but your program prints 0 6. 


Sincerely,
Minseok Jeon
