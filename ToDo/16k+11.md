# Problem 

Show whether the following statement is valid or not.

$\forall n \in \mathbb{N}. \exists m\in \mathbb{N}. f^m(n) = 1$ where $f: n \to n$ is defined as follows:

If $n$ is odd : $f(n)$ = $3n+1$ 
If $n$ is even : $f(n)$ = $n/2$ 



# Language

$Binary : (0|1)^*$

#### Why?
We can easily see various properties if we use binary.

### Property 1

We can easily find odd natural numbers that  applying $f$ makes the number become $2^k$

1, 101, 10101, 1010101, 101010101, $\dots$


### Property 2

We can easily predict the operation of $f$:

X01111 : applying $f^2$ makes X'0111
X'0111 : applying $f^2$ makes X''011
X'011 : applying $f^2$ makes X''01
