ICSE 2025 will follow a dual deadline structure introduced in 2024. In other words, submissions will occur in two cycles. Please refer to the section on Dual Submission Cycles in the following for the information.

**NEW THIS YEAR #1**: Due to the rapid growth of the area of “AI and Software Engineering”, it is now split into two: “AI for Software Engineering” and “Software Engineering for AI”. A new area “Architecture and Design” is introduced. The topics listed under each area have also been revised. Please see the “Research Areas” section below.

**NEW THIS YEAR #2**: We add back opportunities for “Author Response” in addition to “Major Revision” so that some potential misunderstandings can be clarified in the review process for papers that otherwise would be rejected.

**NEW THIS YEAR #3**: Submissions must follow the latest “[IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policy](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/)” and “[ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)” (with associated [FAQ](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions), which includes a policy regarding the use of _generative AI tools and technologies_, such as ChatGPT.
