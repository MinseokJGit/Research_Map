# Problem

Find effective test inputs for endurance test of flash-based storages

# Language

$\widehat{RelWritePattern} : \mathbb{N}^*$
${RelWritePattern} : \mathbb{N}^*$
${WritePattern} : \mathbb{N}^*$

#### Why
An abstract relative write pattern $\hat{\hat{w}} \in \widehat{RelWritePattern}$ describes a set of concrete write pattern that will have similar performance in the endurance test; the search space is reduced.
