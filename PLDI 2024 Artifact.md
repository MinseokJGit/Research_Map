The process consists of the following deadlines and phases:

1. _Artifact registration_: All metadata except the artifact itself should be submitted. Artifact registration gives more time to authors, since bidding can start before the artifact has been submitted.
2. _Artifact submission_: Artifacts should be uploaded to Zenodo and not reveal the authors’ identities.
3. _Response and communication period_: Reviewers will be able to interact (anonymously) with authors for clarifications, system-specific patches, and other logistics help to make the artifact evaluable. The goal of continuous interaction is to prevent rejecting artifacts for minor issues, not research related at all, such as a “wrong library version”-type problem.
4. _Author notification_: Authors will learn about the badges that their artifacts obtained. No camera-ready deadline is given, because Zenodo allows uploading new versions at any time.
